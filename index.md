# Research Paper Analysis
## Md. Hasanur Rashid

### Context & Motivation

Nowadays, there has been an influx of people trying to publish research papers at big conferences. It has been a cumbersome process for the reviewers to go through all the text to better understand the context of the work that the authors are trying to convey. I want to use the product of this project to make the review of the research paper easier for the reviewers.

### Overview

The project mainly consists of three important features.

#### Abstract Data Extraction

The authors typically provide the critical result in the abstract field. I want to find the texts in the description that match the result reported in the abstract.

#### Citation Correlation

I want to find the text that is associated with a specific citation in the description text of the research paper. For example, if a user inputs 1 for the citation field, it will pull up what the citation is as well as the associated text in the description.

#### Figure And Table Details Collation

I want to collect the text for a certain figure or table from user input. The following image shows the collected text for the user if the user inputs 2 in the field of Table.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mrashid2/mrashid2.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mrashid2/mrashid2.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
